    rlib - (more or less sorted) collection of R scripts
==============================================================================

This is a somewhat loose collection of useful R code snippets, functions and 
scripts which do not really warrant separate R packages.

== 1. Documentation ==
Every file should be somewhat self-documenting. Please add a larger comment
at the top of each file; comment on what the code does, preconditions that
need to be met, parameter descriptions, error states, etc. Also provide a
line that mentions who contributed the code and how to contact them.

== 2. Contributors ==
Current contributors (in alphabetical order) are:
    Marc Kirchner <firstname.lastname@childrens.harvard.edu>
